## by Sheila I John

This analysis is based on a data from Kaggle made available by Udacity. Prosper is an online peer-to-peer lending platform which matches borrowers (looking for personal loans between $2,000 and $40,000) with investors. The data set contains 113,937 loan listings with 81 variables. The variables are a mix of alpha and numeric. Most of the data is shared into pre-2009 and post-2009.


## Summary of Findings



After analysis the variable, 90% of the borrowers are employed but in different forms - full-time, part-time, self-employed - and fall within an income range of $25,000-49,999. The rest are either retired, unemployed or did not disclose so are classed as others. The Original amount loaned ranges from $2,000 - $35,000 with the most borrowed amount being around $4500 and this also fall within the range where most delinquencies occur(< $10,000). 
There are at least 19 reason why loans are taken ranging from adoption to medical to cosmetic but the leading reason is DEBT CONSOLIDATION. 16.9% have either defaulted on their payments, are behind due date or had their loans charged off. Knowing that most people borrow to service debts, the figure is not alarming or even surprising. It also show that listings with high prosper score recieve low interest rate and also people with higher income recieve low interest rate as well. This shows that people with higher income pose less risk to the investors.
